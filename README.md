# 🖼️ Image Enhancement Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **image enhancement and processing techniques** using Python in a Google Colab notebook.  
It explores practical methods to improve image quality, apply filters, and visualize transformations for better understanding of digital image processing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn fundamental image processing operations.  
- Perform enhancement techniques such as grayscale conversion, filtering, and edge detection.  
- Provide an interactive notebook for students and beginners to experiment.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **OpenCV** – image manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – visualization  
- **Google Colab** – cloud execution  

## ✨ Features
- Load and display images.  
- Convert between color spaces (RGB, Grayscale, etc.).  
- Apply filters (blurring, sharpening, edge detection).  
- Perform morphological operations (erosion, dilation).  
- Visualize step-by-step transformations.
